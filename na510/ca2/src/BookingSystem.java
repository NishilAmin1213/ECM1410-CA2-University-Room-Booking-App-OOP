3. There is a time-slot concept that will guide the booking system. For instance, rooms will be available, and
assistants will work at a specific time-slot, i.e., date, time and duration. Hence, tests should be booked at
available slots.

4. Every time-slot has a fixed duration â€“ a positive number representing the duration of a test, in minutes. This
quantity includes the time spent doing the test and the time to sanitize the room. The current policy establishes
this duration to be 60 minutes.
